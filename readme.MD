# 🧭 Security Certification Roadmap (RoadmapReDo)

A dynamic, JSON-driven roadmap for cybersecurity certifications across domains, skill levels, and vendors. This project seeks to create a highly structured, visually aligned, and community-extensible planning tool for professionals at all stages of their cybersecurity journey.

---

## 📌 Purpose

- Provide a skill-aligned, vendor-neutral visual roadmap for certification planning.
- Highlight expert pathways, beginner on-ramps, and cross-discipline opportunities.
- Foster community contribution through structured JSON data and layout design.

---

## 🚧 In Progress

This roadmap is being rearchitected to:
- Support flexible filtering by domain, vendor, skill level, and achievement status.
- Precisely align visual elements (cert tiles, domain containers, skill strata).
- Ensure all layout logic is JSON-driven and modular.

Learner mode ON and OFF views are mutually exclusive.
where learner mode 'ON' displays learner selected certs with their designations [achieved/planned/reach] and their css formats; learner mode 'OFF'should display the [index.html initial load/refresh] AKA 'default' roadmap page. and thus none of the learner assigned modifications.

learner mode ON is a custom view of the data, and is saved as a preferential view. So we want to keep persistence [local save], but not display elements of that learner 'on' view while learner mode is 'off'
Does this make sense?
